## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v14.x or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

---

Once cloned, navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd mastermind
Next, install the dependencies using npm:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Configuration
Mastermind uses environment variables for configuration. Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add the following variables:

makefile
Copy code
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret
Replace your_mongodb_uri with your MongoDB connection string and your_session_secret with a random string for session management.

Starting the Server
To start the server, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This will start the server on port 3000 by default. You can access the application by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

Usage
Once the server is running, you can access the Mastermind game in your web browser. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

Development
If you want to make changes to the code and test locally, you can use nodemon for automatic server restarts. Start the server in development mode using:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev


## Installation

To get started, clone the Mastermind repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mastermind.git
